## Installation
In order to install this configuration, you will need to follow the steps below:

1. Backup your current Neovim configuration (if you have one)
```bash
$ mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
```
2. Clone this repository into your Neovim configuration directory
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pvskp/nvim-dotfiles.git ~/.config/nvim
```
3. Start Neovim
```bash
$ nvim
```

[Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) should automatically install all plugins and dependencies. If it doesn't, you can install them manually by running `:Lazy` inside Neovim.

# Troubleshooting
As long this is for personal use, I will not provide any support, but maybe helping to debug some problem. However, feel free to open an issue if you want to suggest something or report a bug.
